## About the development

Originally thought to improve my previous Tic-Tac-Toe game, my new game implements a complete change. Migrated from html, css and plain javascript, to using react, typescript and tailwind.

Inspired by the [awwwards brutalist collection](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/brutalism/), the design is minimalist and monotone. I wanted to add more interactivity, with custom cursors and hovering actions.
