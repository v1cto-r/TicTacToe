# TIC TAC TOE

A Tic Tac Toe game developed in Vite using React, Typescript and TailwindCSS

Currently being hosted on vercel @ https://my-tic-tac.vercel.app/


## About the development

Originally thought to improve my previous Tic-Tac-Toe game, my new game implements a complete change. Migrated from html, css and plain javascript, to using react, typescript and tailwind.

Inspired by the [awwwards brutalist collection](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/brutalism/), the design is minimalist and monotone. There is also a lot of interactivity in the site, with custom cursors and hovering actions.
